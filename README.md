> *I prefer perceiving source code like flowers and software systems like gardens. Software systems live as long as people use them. They need to change, to evolve, to adapt to external and internal environment needs like gardens... By treating software as something organic, we expect change. We learn how to care for it so that when that change comes, weâ€™re ready for it.*
