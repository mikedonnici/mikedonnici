      After completing an Ag. Science degree I did a bit of travel and worked in a variety
      of jobs. In 1994 I returned to Sydney and trained as a Quarantine Officer. In 1997 I
      decided to make the jump to IT and hunkered down on a small farm in the Hunter Valley
      to work and study Computing at Monash Uni, by distance.

      1998: Scored a gig installing data cable for a small company in Port Macquarie where I
      showed a keen interest in all aspects of networking. Within 12 months I was providing network
      support to local businesses including Port Macquarie Base Hospital.

      1999: Moved to Western Australia to start a new job at a small-but-feisty computer
      business located near Margaret River. Whilst there I completed the Microsoft Certified
      Systems Engineer certification (MSCE NT4) and gained a lot of hands-on networking
      experience. I started to tinker with Linux systems and web development.

    <p>
      2000: A stint as a Linux sys admin with an ISP in Goulburn and then back to
      Sydney as a contracted Linux administrator and LAMP stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      2004: Kicked off a small company (Mesa), providing the full range of web design,
      development and hosting services. We developed a range of custom web applications in PHP/MySQL and our  final
      project was a web-based membership system developed for the
      <a

        title="the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand"
        target="_blank"
      >CSANZ</a> in 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
      2014: Employed as the Web Systems Manager with the Cardiac Society with the sole responsibility for ongoing developing
      of their web-based membership system.
    </p>
    <p>
      2019: Commenced as a Senior Software Engineer with <a href="http://humanetix.com.au" target="_blank">Humanetix</a>
      (formerly SmartWard). Thrown headlong into a sea of micro-services, I've coded in Kotlin, written services in Go
      and prototyped a data analytics service in Python. I've worked with Docker, tinkered with AWS CloudFormation and
      experienced being part of a well-run, agile team.
